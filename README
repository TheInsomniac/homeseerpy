A basic Homeseer control base class.

INSTALLATION : install 'python setup.py install'

Usage:
 from homeseerpy import HomeseerPy
 hs = HomeseerPy("IPADDRESS"[, username="username", password"pass"])


Implemented functions
 - control:
        to control Homeseer interfaces
 - status:
        to display the current status interfaces

To control an HS device supporting on/off/dim then enter the following:

    On   : exec housecode on
    Off  : exec housecode off
    DDim : exec housecode ddim level (dims to absolute dim value)
    Dim  : exec housecode dim level (dims relative to current level)

    example : exec B10 ddim 10
              exec B10 on

To set the string of a device such as as virtual device supporting
Play/Pause/Stop any other status bit enter the following:

    string housecode status_string

    example : string B10 Stopped
              string B10 Connected

To obtain the status of a Homeseer interface pass the interface name as the
first argument. If your string has spaces be sure to enclose it in quotes
such as "Motion Detectors". Homeseer IS case sensitive so keep this in mind.
zwave is NOT equivalent to ZWave.

    example: ZWave
             "Motion Detectors"
